# 🧾 Macro Processor (Pass I & Pass II)

This project implements a **Two-Pass Macro Processor** in C++. It demonstrates how macro definitions in an assembly language program are processed and expanded using Pass I and Pass II approach. This is a part of the Laboratory Practice-I (LP-I) coursework.

---

## 📂 Directory Contents

- `pass1.cpp` – Source code for **Pass I** (Macro definition processing)
- `pass2.cpp` – Source code for **Pass II** (Macro expansion)
- `input.txt` – Input assembly program containing macros
- `MNT.txt` – Macro Name Table generated by Pass I
- `MDT.txt` – Macro Definition Table generated by Pass I
- `ALA.txt` – Argument List Array used in both passes
- `output.txt` – Final expanded assembly code generated by Pass II

---

## 🔧 How It Works

### 🔁 Pass I: Macro Definition
- Identifies `MACRO` and `MEND` directives.
- Stores macro names in **MNT**.
- Stores macro bodies in **MDT**.
- Tracks macro parameters in **ALA**.

### 🔄 Pass II: Macro Expansion
- Identifies macro calls in the input.
- Uses **MNT**, **MDT**, and **ALA** to replace macros with expanded code.
- Writes the expanded assembly program to `output.txt`.

---

## 🧪 Example

### 📥 input.txt
```assembly
MACRO
INCR &ARG1
ADD &ARG1,1
MEND
START
INCR A
INCR B
END
```

### 📤 output.txt
```assembly
START
ADD A,1
ADD B,1
END
```
